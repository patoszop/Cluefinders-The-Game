## 🔎 About The Project

This is a demo version of **Cluefinders**, a unique logic and puzzle game built around the principles of **web development and code scavenging**.

The game is wrapped in a distinctive **Windows 98/Retro** aesthetic. To progress, players must combine classic puzzle-solving skills with technical knowledge, often requiring them to use the browser's Developer Tools (F12) to uncover hidden elements, decode messages, and find passwords embedded in the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

This project serves as a showcase of what can be built using purely front-end web technologies to create an engaging, interactive experience.

### 🚧 Development Status

This game is currently **under active development**. If you reach a point where clicking the "Proceed to level X" link leads you to a non-existent page (a 404 error), it means you have completed all content available in the current demo version.

## 🎮 Gameplay and Core Mechanics

The core goal is to advance through multiple levels by solving puzzles that intentionally exploit features and functionalities of a standard web page:

1.  **Visual Scavenging:** Searching for subtle or hidden elements on the screen.
2.  **Code Analysis:** Using the browser's **Developer Console (F12)** to inspect the Document Object Model (DOM), analyze CSS rules, and review JavaScript logic to find clues.
3.  **Cipher Decoding:** Applying simple ciphers or logic to codes found in the elements to generate the key for the next stage.

The player's progress (unlocked levels) is saved locally using **LocalStorage**.
